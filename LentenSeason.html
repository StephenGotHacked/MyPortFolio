                                          Palm Sunday commemorates the Christian belief in the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, when he was greeted by cheering crowds waving palm branches that they set out on the ground along his path, according to the Bible.

                                          Palm Sunday, in the Christian tradition, the first day of Holy Week and the Sunday before Easter, commemorating Jesus Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It is associated in many churches with the blessing and procession of palms (leaves of the date palm or twigs from locally available trees).

                                          As you continue your pilgrimage through Holy Week, Monday is an opportunity to slow down and reflect the humanity of Jesus.

                                          On this day, Jesus entered the temple, made a whip out of chords, flipped the tables of money changers, and drove them out of the sacred space. Many people relate to this moment in Jesus’ life because it reveals that he too felt the very human emotion of anger.
                                        </li>
                                        <br>

                                          One great way to observe the Monday of Holy Week is to go to Confession. Allow God’s forgiveness to wash over you so that you can let go of any anger or resentment that is lingering in your heart.

                                          Tuesday was a busy day for Jesus and the disciples. So much happened on this day, including Jesus calling out the Pharisees, teaching by the fig tree, and preaching extensively on the Mount of Olives.
                                        </li>

                                          One great way to observe Tuesday of Holy Week is to deep clear your home. This tradition arises from the Jewish custom of preparing the home for Passover. Often, decluttering our homes is an avenue to decluttering our souls.

                                          You can reflect further on Tuesday of Holy Week by reading Matthew 21:23-27, Matthew 22: 34-40, or Matthew 26:6-13.

                                          Wednesday of Holy Week is often called Spy Wednesday. Why? Because this is the day Judas Iscariot spies on Jesus, secretly plotting to have him arrested.
                                        </li>
                                        <br>

                                          On this day, Judas goes to the chief priests and asks them how much money they’d be willing to give him if he turned Jesus in. 30 pieces of silver is enough for him to turn on Jesus, all of the disciples, and the future he had with a life of faith.
                                        </li>
                                        <br>

                                          One common way to observe Spy Wednesday is to eat simple meals, offering the sacrifice as a prayer to Jesus. You can reflect further on Spy Wednesday by reading Matthew 26:14-16.

                                          Holy Thursday is the first day of the Easter Triduum, the most sacred days of the Catholic faith. It begins with the Mass of the Lord’s Supper, commemorating the Last Supper celebrated by Jesus and his disciples on the Jewish holiday of Passover. It’s not a Holy Day of Obligation, but many Catholics attend Mass. 
                                        </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li>
                                          Jesus was clear. “This is my Body. Eat it.” And “This is my Blood. Drink it.” “Do this in remembrance of me.” It’s not a symbol or a metaphor. It’s a clear and direct command. Jesus impresses upon His disciples that this is a sacred meal of His Body and Blood and that they should continue this practice after He is gone.
                                        </li>
                                        <br>

                                          For over two thousand years, Catholics have taken Jesus at his word and obeyed the command he gave on his final night through the sacred ritual of the Mass.
                                        </li>

                                          One powerful way to remember Good Friday is by maintaining silence throughout the day, especially between 12 pm and 3 pm (when Jesus was on the Cross). Although there is no Mass, many people still visit their church to attend a Stations of the Cross service. You could also spend time meditating on the Passion of Jesus by reading the Passion accounts in the Gospel or watching a movie adaptation like The Passion of the Christ.
