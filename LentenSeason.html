                            Lent is the season of the church year that follows the Epiphany Season. It is a time we set aside each year to remember the love of God that is poured out through Christ Jesus on the cross in His death; and His defeat of death, sin and Satan in Christ’s death and resurrection that brings Eternal Life to you. This season has a penitential character, a solemn nature to it. This is to help us remember to be repentant and remind us of our sin and our mortality.

                          Palm Sunday commemorates the Christian belief in the triumphal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, when he was greeted by cheering crowds waving palm branches that they set out on the ground along his path, according to the Bible.
                          <br><br>
                          Palm Sunday, in the Christian tradition, the first day of Holy Week and the Sunday before Easter, commemorating Jesus Christ’s triumphal entry into Jerusalem. It is associated in many churches with the blessing and procession of palms (leaves of the date palm or twigs from locally available trees).

                          As you continue your pilgrimage through Holy Week, Monday is an opportunity to slow down and reflect the humanity of Jesus.
                          
                          <br><br>
  
                          One great way to observe the Monday of Holy Week is to go to Confession. Allow God’s forgiveness to wash over you so that you can let go of any anger or resentment that is lingering in your heart.
                          
                          <br><br>
  
                          You can reflect further on Monday of Holy Week by reading John 2:13-22.

                        <div class="des">
                          Tuesday was a busy day for Jesus and the disciples. So much happened on this day, including Jesus calling out the Pharisees, teaching by the fig tree, and preaching extensively on the Mount of Olives.
                          <br><br>
                          One great way to observe Tuesday of Holy Week is to deep clear your home. This tradition arises from the Jewish custom of preparing the home for Passover. Often, decluttering our homes is an avenue to decluttering our souls.
                          <br><br>
                          You can reflect further on Tuesday of Holy Week by reading Matthew 21:23-27, Matthew 22: 34-40, or Matthew 26:6-13.

                          Wednesday of Holy Week is often called Spy Wednesday. Why? Because this is the day Judas Iscariot spies on Jesus, secretly plotting to have him arrested.
                          <br><br>
                          One common way to observe Spy Wednesday is to eat simple meals, offering the sacrifice as a prayer to Jesus. You can reflect further on Spy Wednesday by reading Matthew 26:14-16.

It’s not a Holy Day of Obligation, but many Catholics attend Mass.
                        <br><br>

                        One powerful way to remember Good Friday is by maintaining silence throughout the day, especially between 12 pm and 3 pm (when Jesus was on the Cross).
                        <br><br>
                        Good Friday, observed on March 29 this year, is a significant day for Christians worldwide. It commemorates the crucifixion and death of Jesus Christ, preceding Easter Sunday, which celebrates his resurrection.

                        Holy Saturday is a day of preparation for Easter. For some families this might mean praying together, preparing their home for guests, and dying Easter Eggs. Although there is no Mass offered in the morning, many churches host a short prayer service. When night falls, the Church officially begins its first Easter Celebration at the Easter Vigil Mass!
                        <br><br>
                        Holy Saturday is a day of quiet reflection and anticipation for Christians around the world.
